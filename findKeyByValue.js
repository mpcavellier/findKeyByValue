/* Lodash has a function findKey and we're going to implement something similar but simpler. It will help us search for a key on an object where its value matches a given value. */

/* Implement the function findKeyByValue which takes in an object and a value. It should scan the object and return the first key which contains the given value. If no key with that given value is found, then it should return undefined. While this function is similar to Lodash's findKey function, the second argument is different. This is done to keep our challenge more relevant and simpler for now. */
